Bypronto Development
====================

Vagrant development for Bypronto based on VVV

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install Vagrant plugins. Run the following commands:
  1. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
  2. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers`
2. Run `sh bypronto-setup.sh`. 
3. The script above creates a new folder called `vvv-bypronto` outside this repository. We can do our development there.
4. Happy coding!
